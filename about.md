**Colin Narans** is a web developer living in Omaha, Nebraska.  After growing up in the remarkably flat town of Fremont, Nebraska, Colin attended UNL, where he recieved his Bachelor's in History, with minors in Computer Science and Math.  Unfortunately, the history factory wasn't hiring, and after a few years in the insurance industry, he decided web programming was the thing for him.
